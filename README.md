# New Tutorial
You can now access a no-cost training resource that walks you through the basic setup and use of MapSAR Online https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/prepare-for-search-and-rescue-incidents/

# MapSAR Online
MapSAR Online is a NAPSG Foundation SAR Working Group research and development project to enable WiSAR teams to easily use web mapping for SAR operations. Please feel free to experiment with this map and use the tools. We will use this app to experiment with user interface, implementation, deployment, symbology, etc. For ArcGIS Desktop versions, see sister projects https://github.com/dferguso/MapSAR_Ex and www.mapsar.net.

*UPDATE: We are working on revising the MapSAR Online Feature Layer template with the Mountain Rescue Association and NAPSG SAR Working Group

# MapSAR Pro
ArcGIS Pro template for Search and Rescue with advanced spatial analysis https://github.com/dferguso/MapSAR_Pro

# Developers 
Data Model - If you go the item property website (this is "metadata" page for the editable layers in the map) you can export the data model (and sample data) in a variety of formats (shp, csv, kml, fgdb, geojson) by clicking on Export Data. https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f412081560ec4074ac16e2161f7d5def 

Application - The actual web mapping application configured for situational awareness is out-of-the-box Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS (I am not a developer!). You can learn more about this framework here https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/
